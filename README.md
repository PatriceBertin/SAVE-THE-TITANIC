# SAVE-THE-TITANIC


## Objective

Enhance the existing algorithm to dynamically navigate the Titanic away from randomized iceberg positions, ensuring collision avoidance and safe passage through the ocean. The function auto_pilot_next_step must intelligently analyze the current position of the Titanic and the size of the ocean to determine the optimal direction for navigation, prioritizing avoidance of iceberg collisions. This requires adaptability and responsiveness to varying scenarios, enabling effective decision-making to ensure the Titanic's safe passage through the unpredictable waters.
